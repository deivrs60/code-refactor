# module-I
This is my code for the Week 1 & 2 Module 1 Challenge: Code Refactor.
It went through the HTML and created Semantics to make it easier to navigate from section to section, as well as added comment tags to help with that.
I reorganized the order of some of the HTML Code in order to allow it to properly display on the webpage.
Removed CSS properties from the HTML code, to make it easier to track/read.
Edited + Added ALT properties for the images.
Condensed CSS Style Sheet to minimize repetitive code.
Added helpful comments to CSS Style Sheet.

Lack of commits as I just kept saving and refreshing my adjustments to the code in browser. :(
